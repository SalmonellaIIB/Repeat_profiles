This script is an automatized example of how this script works and the files created.

Just run the script from command line or Python interpreter and the work is done.
From command line use the line: $'python get_mitogenomes.py'

Make sure to have a list called 'ids.txt' that contains the NCBI IDs you want to analyze


The script will create a folder called 'repeats', with two subfolders. The folder named 'fasta' are the mitogenomes in fasta format. The folder called results contain the direct and inverted repeat sequences identified.
