# Repeat Profiles Library

## Overview
Repeat_Profiles is a flexible sequence repeats identificator and anotator Python 3 library.

  - Detection de novo of all possible direct and inverted repeat sequences in mitochondrial genomes.
  - Adaptable to multiple set of data and specific user requirements.
  - User-defined output formats.

## Version
2.0

##  To build the example

Step 1. Make sure that you have installed [Python 3.4 or superior](https://www.python.org/)


Step 2. We recommend using Linux or Macoperating system, but you can run the scripts without problem in Windows


Step 3. Download the directory [example](https://github.com/SalmonellaIIB/Repeat_profiles/tree/master/example) from this webpage.


Step 4. Enter into the folder. You will encounter all the scripts and files necessary identify direct and inverted repeats. From /example/ directory.

```
$ ./python get_mitogenomes.py
```

The script will create a folder called 'repeats', with two subfolders. The folder named 'fasta' are the mitogenomes in fasta format. The folder called 'results' contain the direct and inverted repeat sequences identified.


- For more details about how to run the scripts loon into the file Manual, read the article by Noel Cabañas *et al.* or contact me.
