SRD-5.csv----->This file is an example of an output file of 1.6.py script. It contains all the DRS identified in a mitogenome, including the number of times that a sequence is repeated, the sequences repeated itself, and the start positions of every sequence identified.

SRI-5.csv----->This file is an example of an output file of 1.6.py script. It contains all the IRS identified in a mito genome, including the number of times that a sequence is repeated, the sequences repeated itself, and the start positions of every sequence identified.

resultadosSRD.txt.csv----->This is a file generated by 1.6.py, and shows the number of DRS in each mitogenome and in each size. In case you only want to know the number.

resultadosSRI.txt.csv----->This is a file generated by 1.6.py, and shows the number of IRS in each mitogenome and in each size. In case you only want to know the number.
