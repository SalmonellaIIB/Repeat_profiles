#These files were created by Noel CabaÃ±as in order to perform analyses of repeat sequences in amphibian mitogenomes. 
This README lists all the files in this repository.

Amphibians.txt----->This are all the data collected of the amphibians

1.6.py----->This is the main Script that identify the DRS and IRS and generate .cvs files 

modules.py----->This Script is used by the 1.6.py script, both need to be in the same directory.

NC_multifasta----->This program can split a multifast file in individuals fast files, and rename every file with the ID access.

ramdom_seq.py----->This script randomize a sequence of nucleotides ten times.

SRD-5.csv----->This file is an example of an output file of 1.6.py script. It contains all the DRS identified in a mitogenome, including the number of times that a sequence is repeated, the sequences repeated itself, and the start positions of every sequence identified.

SRI-5.csv----->This file is an example of an output file of 1.6.py script. It contains all the IRS identified in a mito genome, including the number of times that a sequence is repeated, the sequences repeated itself, and the start positions of every sequence identified.

resultadosSRD.txt.csv----->This is a file generated by 1.6.py, and shows the number of DRS in each mitogenome and in each size. In case you only want to know the number.

resultadosSRI.txt.csv----->This is a file generated by 1.6.py, and shows the number of IRS in each mitogenome and in each size. In case you only want to know the number.


221_seq_anfibios.fasta----->This file contains all the amphibian mitogenomes in fast format used in the analyses.

221_seq_anfibios.gb----->This file contains all the amphibian mitogenomes in gbank format used in the analyses.

IDs.txt----->This file contains the ID access numbers of the 221 amphibian mitogenomes
