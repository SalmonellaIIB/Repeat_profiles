You will be able to find here the scripts and data employed to identify direct repeat sequences in the article "Repetitive DNA profile of the Amphibian mitogenome" of Noel Cabañas et al.(Still in peer review).

This repository contains 6 folders.

#Scripts:This directory contains the necessary scripts to identify direct and inverted repeat sequences in amphibian mitogenomes.

#Data: This directory contains the data sets Noel et al. used in the article "Repetitive DNA profile of the Amphibian mitogenome". 

#Results: Shows the examples of the aoutputs obtained with the scripts.

#example:This directory contains all the data and scripts to run an example of the analysis performed by Noel et al.
If you want to see the result only download the folder and execute the script "get_mitogenomes.py". You will be able to replicate the the analyses of Noel et al.

#Supplementary: This folder contains the supplementary material that supports the article "Repetitive DNA profile of the Amphibian mitogenome" of Noel Cabañas et al.(Still in peer review).
